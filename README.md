## Use-a-Pre-trained-Image-Classifier-to-Identify-Dog-Breeds
This is my first project in AI programming with Python Nanodegree program by Udacity

<b>Project Scope:</b>

In this project we had the following objectives:

1. Identifying which pet images are of dogs and which pet images aren't of dogs
2. Classifying the breeds of dogs, for the images that are of dogs
3. Determine which CNN model architecture (ResNet, AlexNet, or VGG16), "best" achieve the objectives 1 and 2.

The project meets the specifications outlined in the 'Results Table', which identified:

Model VGG was the superior CNN Architecture Model - able to classify "dogs" and "not-a-dog" with 100% accuracy and had the best performance regarding breed classification with 100% accuracy.
